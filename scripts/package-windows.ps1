# Produces, for the host architecture:
#   dist\ms_licenses-windows-<arch>.dll          the prebuilt library (the release asset)
#   dist\ms_licenses-windows-<arch>.dll.sha256   its checksum (sha256sum format)
# and refreshes the in-repo loadable (ms_licenses.dll) so a locally-run Limen picks up
# this build on Reload.
#
# The asset name must end in .dll and contain the CPU-arch token, with a matching
# .sha256 - that's exactly what Limen's module manager checks before offering a
# native module on a platform.
#
# There is no Unix equivalent, deliberately: the module declares
# os = ["windows"] because the licensing store it reads exists nowhere else, so
# a .so built from these sources is an artifact no machine could ever load.
#
# For local testing before the SDK is published, point the git dependencies at a
# local checkout of the Limen repo (this module needs both limen-sdk-rust and
# limen-proto, and they come from the same git URL, so one path covers both):
